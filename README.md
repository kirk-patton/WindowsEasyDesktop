Simplified Windows Desktop Settings 

## Seniors Difficulty With Windows

Windows has a good deal of functionality that many people find confusing and are unlikely to use.

* Drag & Drop
* Minimize / Maximize
* Double Click & Right Click
* Menus upon menus and settings...

When setting up Windows for my mother, the things I would consider simple are often the most challenging for her.
A good example is the Right-Click menu and the Double-Click(launch) vs. Single click(select).  My mom really just wants
to read and write e-mail, and all the other features in Windows end up causing her grief.  

## Restricted Setup - Less Is More

Git rid of Windows distractions that cause confusion and disable or simplify features. 

* Restrict the User account(NonAdmin) - Don't let applications be installed

* Don't Require a Login Password - Not good security practice though...
  * For this to work, a local account may be required (Not a MS Cloud Account)

* Set Windows Task bar to AutoHide

```Right Click empty area of taskbar and select "Taskbar Settings"
   "Automatically Hide Taskbar in Desktop Mode"```
